    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Hello, my name is Dustin Trinh</h3>
    <p>I am majoring in Software Engineering with an emphasis in Web Development and Design. I want to solve a single problem in the world, BAD WEBSITES. I know that's a near impossible task, but I want everyone to have a good experience when going on smaller or bigger companiy sites. Ultimately, I'm just an average guy trying to learn how to code! </p>
